# Personal Website

This repo is a clone of [Brittany Chiang's personal website](https://github.com/bchiang7/bchiang7.github.io). However this is not a fork, and I've made extensive modifications.

This project was originally written in Jekyll and Gulp by Brittany Chiang. I have converted the entire project to Gatsby, while retaining the original design.

## Getting Started

1.  `npm install`
2.  `npm run develop`
